     * Deep-copy this queue into a NEW PQueue instance (no node sharing).
     * .
     * How to construct:
     * 1) For an empty queue, return a new empty queue immediately.
     * 2) Otherwise, walk through the elements from the front to the back.
     *    - For each element, create a fresh node holding the same value.
     *    - Link each new node to the end of a newly built list, keeping track of
     *      its first (head) and last (tail) nodes as you go. For the first element,
     *      both head and tail refer to the same new node; thereafter, extend the tail.
     * 3) Keep a running count of how many elements were copied, and return a new
     *    queue built from the newly constructed head and tail together with that count.
     * .
     * Why:
     * - Persistence: do not modify the original queue. Returning a fresh structure
     *   that shares no nodes with the original preserves all previous versions.
     * .
     * Complexity:
     * - Time O(n), Space O(n) new nodes, where n = numElements.
     *
     * @return a new PQueue<> with the same sequence of elements as this queue.

     * 2) If the two queues have different numbers of elements, the result is false.

     *   variable ‘pq’ if the check succeeds (pattern matching for ‘instanceof’).
     * - The ‘<?>’ is the unbounded wildcard, meaning “a PQueue of some unknown element type”.

     *   but you should not write values into ‘pq’.
